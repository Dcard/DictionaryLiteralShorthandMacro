/// A macro that creates a Swift dictionary literal wherein the keys are string representations of the corresponding valuesâ€™ variable names.
/// For example:
/// let a = 1
/// let b = "Foo"
/// let dict = #dictionaryLiteralShorthand([a, b])
///
/// produces a dictionary literal with type: [AnyHashable: Any]
///
/// ["a": a, "b": b]
///
/// Basically the same as: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/nsdictionaryofvariablebindings , but in Swift.
